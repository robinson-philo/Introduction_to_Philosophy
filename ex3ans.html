       <td width="33%">1. Melinda's father is suffering from a gradually
worsening dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. She has a deep respect for
her father, a man who has always felt a deep sense of personal responsibility
and has valued his independence and sense of self- reliance. He still insists
on making his own decisions, but lately he has suffered from significant
memory loss, and this has caused Melinda to be concerned about his welfare.
She is considering whether she should take greater responsibility for making
important decisions about his treatment and his living situation, despite
his father's protests that he can take care of himself.<br>
        </td>
       <td width="67%">The ethical question concerns primarily a conflict 
between the <b>principles of autonomy</b> and <b>beneficence</b>.  Autonomy 
normally requires that we respect that decisions that individuals make concerning 
their own welfare, but in cases where someone clearly is unable to take care 
of themselves, the duty of beneficence would take precedence.  This is a case
of the "grey area," where it is not so clear whether the father's growing 
dementia is severe enough to justifyoverruling his own decisions for the sake,
of his welfare.</td>

        <td width="33%">2. Jason is a lawyer who is currently representing
 Company Y in contract negotiations with Company X. The crucial meeting is 
today: if final agreements are not reached, Company X has said that they will
end negotiations. Another client calls--a customer is suing her company for
marketing a harmful product. She needs to talk with Jason over legal strategies
in the case. Jason cannot help both client's today, although both client's
clearly need his help. Jason weighs his obligations to both clients.    
 </td>
       <td width="67%">This is a case of conflicting loyalties.  The loyalty 
we have as moral agents based on special relationships to others, such as, 
in this case, professional-client relationships, can be understood as based 
in the <b>principle of promise-keeping</b>: we make explicit or implicit promises
to our family, friends, business or professional associates, clients, etc.,
that we will faithfully work with them to achieve common ends and come to
their aid in time of need. Such explicit or implicit promises may come into
conflict, such as in this case.  Another principle that can apply at such
times is the <b>principle of beneficence</b>: if Jason's help will aid one
of his clients more significantly than the other, then that can be the basis
for deciding where the stronger obligation lies.</td>

        <td width="33%">3. Milly Thompson works for a charity organization
 that provides funds for inner city projects that help the poor. She has
been talking with a potential donor who is willing to give a very large sum
of money to the charity, but this donor is deeply prejudiced against Hispanics, 
and is not willing to give any money to projects in Hispanic neighborhoods. 
The potential donor asks Milly directly whether any of the money that he would
donate would go to such projects. Currently the only projects that the charity
is funding are projects in Hispanic neighborhoods, and Board of Directors
of the charity has stipulated that all current donations must go to these
projects. Times are hard, and very few donations are currently  coming in.
In fact, without this donation, many of the current projects will have to
be canceled. Milly considers what she should do: lie to the donor or tell
the truth.</td>
       <td width="67%">Clearly the <b>principle of honesty</b> applies in 
this case: this principle would require that Milly tell the donor the truth. 
 On the other hand, the <b>principle of beneficence</b> would suggest that 
Milly should do what it takes to secure the donation for the sake of the good
this will do for the poor.  Complicating the issue is the question of whether
a charity should take money from donors who place stipulations born out of
personal prejudices on their donations, stipulations that may require in
the future that the charity make decisions as to who they benefit on the irrelevant
basis of the ethnic heritage of the beneficiaries.  This involves a consideration
of the <b>principle of equality</b>.</td>

        <td width="33%">4. Mary James, a state representative, has just received 
confidential information that a Company X, that has a chemical processing 
plant in James' district, has not taken proper safety precautions to assure 
that the region around the plant is protected from dangerous contamination. 
There are some 300 residents in the area, and there is a significant danger 
that their health may be jeopardized if the situation continues. On the other 
hand, Company X has been threatening to close the plant in James' constituency, 
which would put some 6,000 people out of work. If James releases the information, 
this would surely lead Company X to close the plant. James is considering 
whether she has the moral responsibility to release the information or not.</td>
       <td width="67%">The primary issue involves a conflict in the application 
of the <b>principle of nonmaleficence</b>: releasing the information will 
harm the employees of the plant who will be out of a job, but failing to release
the information will mean that local residents will receive no warning of
a potential danger to their health, which may result in their being harmed. 
 The <b>principle of honesty</b> also is involved.  If James does not release 
the information, and James makes no statement to the effect that there is 
no danger, then James, of course, will not be lying to anyone.  But James' 
constituents might have the expectation that any public official who had information
concerning a public health risk would warn the public, which would mean that
although James does not lie, she may be thought at least to deceive the local
residents by her failure to offer a warning.</td>

        <td width="33%">5. In the summer of 1945 Harry S. Truman, President
 of the United States, had a difficult decision to make. While it was quite
 clear that Japan would eventually be defeated, the Japanese were showing
no sign of surrender. It appeared likely that to defeat Japan, an invasion
Japan would be necessary. However such an invasion would take a devastating
toll on both sides: estimates of losses on both sides ranged into the millions,
 and an invasion would surely mean a long protraction of the war. Due to
the success of the "Manhattan Project" there was an alternative: dropping
an atomic bomb on Japanese territory might convince the Japanese generals
of the futility of their position. A drop on an unpopulated area might be
tried, but because the Japanese military had shown an obstinate willingness
to fight to the last, it was believed that such an act would not be likely
to lead to a surrender. If dropping the bomb was to be successful, it was
thought, it would have to be dropped on a populated area of some strategic
importance to the Japanese. But this, of course, meant certain death for
tens of thousands of Japanese.</td>
       <td width="67%">The historical and ethical issues of the case are
complex, and still hotly debated, but two moral principles that clearly apply
in this case are the principles of <b>nonmaleficence</b> and <b>beneficence</b>. 
 Dropping the atomic bomb on a populated area meant killing tens of thousands 
(a violation of the principle of nonmaleficence).  On the other hand, it had
the potential of saving the lives of many thousands of U.S. soldiers as well
as tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers and civilians who would be lost
in an invasion of Japan (principle of beneficence).  In this case, as in
other cases of international relations in war and peace, a conflict between
the principles of <b>promise-keeping</b> and <b>equality (justice)</b> applies
as well.  The President has a responsibility to safeguard national interests,
a responsibility that can be understood to stem from a promise that the President
makes to the nation upon the assumption of power.  This responsibility would
endorse, in this case, a greater concern for the welfare of U.S. soldiers
over the welfare of the Japanese.  On the other hand, there are limits to
such favoritism based on the principle of equality, which, applied strictly,
would require an equal consideration of the welfare of all people, regardless
of national status.  One such limit long recognized in the history of warfare
is that noncombatants in a conflict should not be targets of direct attack,
which they surely were when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
even if such action would achieve military objectives.  Although this prohibition
was violated many times during WW II, by all sides, this provides no valid
basis for the claim that it may be ignored in this case.</td>

        <td width="33%">6. David, a single father, has promised his seven-year-old 
son that he would attend his son's baseball game on Saturday. On Saturday 
morning, however, a close friend, John, calls. John, who has been unemployed 
for six months, has just been asked to interview for a new job, and if he 
doesn't show up today he loses his one firm prospect for employment. John's 
wife is away on a trip, and he needs someone to look after his infant daughter. 
He tells David he's tried everyone he can think of, and David is his last 
hope. David does not want to disappoint his son, but he knows he couldn't 
attend the baseball game if he takes care of John's daughter for the day.</td>
       <td width="67%">This case involves a conflict between the ethical
demands of <b>promise-keeping</b> and <b>beneficence</b>.  As in case two
above, we might understand this case as involving a conflict of loyalties
based on the explicit promise that David made to his son against the implicit
promise to render aid in time of need that in part defines the ethical basis
of David's friendship with John.  The question is, which promise is more
significant?  The principle of beneficence would require that David help
out his friend John, but this does not mean necessarily that David's prima
facie obligation to John is stronger than his obligation to his son.  When
one action is supported by two ethical principles and an alternative action
is supported by one principle, this does not necessarily mean that the first
action defines our obligation.  Some consideration of the nature and importance
of the prima facie obligations themselves is required.</td>

        <td width="33%">7. Tom and Steve are fellow foot soldiers fighting
 a war. They are part of a major offensive against the enemy in a conflict,
 an offensive that is failing--their division is being forced by the enemies
 counteroffensive to retreat. Tom and Steve become separated from the rest
 of their division when Steve is hit by shrapnel from an exploding mortar
round. Steve is apparently gravely wounded, but is conscious and appears
lucid. Believing that he is about to die in any case, Steve urges Tom to
leave him and retreat to safety. Tom believes that he might have a chance
to save Steve if he can carry him to safety in time, but knows that this
will involve a grave risk to himself, and might very well be futile. He wonders
whether he should respect the wishes of Steve, or take the risk to himself
and attempt to save Steve's life. </td>
       <td width="67%">This case raises prudential and ethical issues that 
are interconnected.  Tom must consider the risk that he would face in his 
attempt to save Steve.  This is a prudential issue, but it has implications 
with respect to how the <b>principle of beneficence</b> applies in the case. 
 The principle of beneficence would require that Tom save Steve, but only 
if the risk to Tom's personal safety is not extreme and the prospect of saving 
Steve is not hopeless (the factual issue of risk pertains crucially to the 
moral issue of obligation here; if the risk is great, Tom's attempt to save 
Steve would be praiseworthy on moral grounds, but not required--in other words,
it would be a supererogatory act).  Complicating the issue is Steve's insistence
that he should be left to die.  If Steve is lucid enough to make a competent
judgment, then the <b>principle of autonomy</b> would suggest that his wishes
should be respected.  But here the factual issue of competence is the key--is
Steve's assessment of the situation a reasonable one, or is it born out of
foggy thinking and a sense of hopelessness caused by his wounds?</td>

as a clerk in a bank. His boss approaches him with a problem: there has been 
a confusion in the records of several of the depositors, which had the effect 
of crediting too much interest to some accounts and not enough to others. 
Mark immediately realizes that he was the cause of the error: he wasn't terribly 
careful the other day, thinking about the vacation he would take. He fears 
for his job if his boss discovers the truth. His boss asks Mark if he caused 
the confusion, and Mark considers whether he should lie about the whole thing</td>
       <td width="67%">This is actually not a moral dilemma, although it
may be a personal one.  The <b>principle of honesty</b> applies to the case, 
requiring that Mark tell the truth, but this principle is not in conflict 
with any other principle representing a moral value that is pertinent to this
case, although the principle is in conflict with a prudential concern of
Mark's: saving his job.        
      <p>Note: We will consider in this course one ethical theory that might 
be applied in this case to suggest that a moral question is at stake--ethical 
egoism.  But as we will see, ethical egoism is a problematic theory that conflicts
strongly with common moral intuitions.</p>

government. She has just been informed that a number of people at a local 
office building have become suddenly ill. Upon investigation, she finds that 
their is a highly contagious virus that is being that is making people in 
the building ill, and she wants to keep the virus contained so that others 
outside the building are not contaminated. She considers the option of quarantining 
everyone in the building, but wonders whether a quarantine, which would confine 
the occupants of the building for days or weeks, is justified by the threat 
that the virus poses to public health.</td>
       <td width="67%">This case involves a conflict between <b>beneficence</b> 
and <b>autonomy</b>.  A quarantine would severely restrict the lives of the 
people within the building (violating the principle of autonomy), but this 
action is supported by the principle of beneficence, since it would safeguard 
the health of the general public. [One might be tempted to appeal to the principle
of <b>nonmaleficence</b> in this case: if Cheryl does not impose a quarantine,
she is thereby allowing the public to be harmed by the virus.  But typically
failing to prevent harm (rather than directly causing harm) is understood
by ethicists as a violation of the principle of beneficence.]  Finally, the
principle of <b>equality</b> is involved, since Cheryl must consider the
interests of each occupant of the building and each person outside the building
who might be in danger of being infected by the virus on an equal basis.</td>

observes a car racing down the highway at 20 miles per hour above the legal
speed limit. He gives chase, and pulls the car over. When he comes over to
the driver's side to give the driver a ticket, the driver explains that her
husband is having a heart attack, and needs to get to a hospital. David's
has the responsibility to give the driver a ticket. On the other hand, he
determines that the medical emergency is real, requiring immediate attention,
which would preclude taking the time to fill out a ticket. </td>
       <td width="67%">The principle of <b>equality</b> would require that 
everyone living in a certain jurisdiction should be subject to the same laws, 
and the laws should apply equally to everyone who violates those laws.  But 
in this case, the principle of <b>beneficence</b> suggests a reasonable exception: 
in order to safeguard the health of the driver's husband, David should forget 
about the ticket and escort the couple to the nearest hospital.       
      <p>Actually this moral dilemma could be avoided without sacrificing 
the moral values of equality or beneficence: David could escort the couple 
to the hospital and then, once the husband has received medical attention, 
he could give the driver a ticket.</p>
